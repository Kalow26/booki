# Project for openClassRoom #3

## Presentation

Booki is a french start-up. As a Junior dveloper, i have in charge to develop a website who allows user to find accomodations or discover activities in the city of their choice !
I was responsible for integrating the interface of the website using HTML & CSS. To achieve this i worked in collaboration with Sarah the CTO and Lo√Øc, the UI Designer.

## Process.

I first started by studying all the mock-up Lo√Æc provided me.

I had to develop the *Mobile*, *Tablet* and *Desktop* version of the site üëç

### The Website is Divided in 3 sections

1. the Navbar
2. Hero Section
3. The accomodations and Popular Section
4. The activities available in the city section
5. The footer

The main objective of the project was to improve my HTML semantic, and work with basic CSS.

### Code

I tried my best to use the best HTML tags and comment the most my code. My goal was to have the cleanest code and start working with good practicies.

I use the BEM methodology for the CSS

This is a great way to organise your CSS properly, but i think this method is better in use with SCSS.
By the way it was a good project to develop, i'm pretty happy with the result.
And the final version is completely responsive and match perfectly all the mockups !

Hope your enjoy, and see you for my next Project üëå
